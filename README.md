# Sorting Machine Project

 This project involves the development of an automated sorting machine using Arduino, servo motors, and an ultrasonic sensor.

## Description

The Sorting Machine project is designed to automate the sorting of objects based on their height. It utilizes an Arduino microcontroller for controlling servo motors that manipulate a robotic arm to pick and place objects into designated bins. The height of each object is detected in real-time using an ultrasonic sensor (HC-SR04), ensuring precise sorting.

## Features

- **Automated Sorting**: Objects are sorted automatically based on their height.
- **Real-Time Measurement**: Ultrasonic sensor provides accurate height detection.
- **Mechanical Design**: Mechanical parts designed using Fusion 360 for precise assembly.
- **Arduino Control**: Arduino microcontroller coordinates servo motor movements and sensor readings.

## Technologies Used

- **Arduino**: Controls servo motors and manages sensor data.
- **Fusion 360**: Used for designing and modeling mechanical components.
- **Servo Motors**: Control the movement of the sorting mechanism.
- **Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04)**: Measures the height of objects for sorting.
